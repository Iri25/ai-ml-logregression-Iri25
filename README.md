Developing self-learning systems. Classification problems solved with the method logistic regression. Evaluating the performance of these methods

It is considered information about breast cancer in women, information extracted from breast ultrasounds (details at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnosis))) such as:

- Type of malformation identified (benign tissue or malignant tissue)
- 
- Numerical characteristics of the nucleus of cells in these tissues:
a radius (average distances between the center and the points on the contour)
a texture (measured by the standard deviation of the gray levels in the associated image of the analyzed tissue)

Using this data, decide whether the tissue from a new ultrasound (for which they are known the 2 numerical characteristics - radius and texture -) will be labeled as malignant or benign.

Theme: What kind of flower do you prefer?
It is considered the problem of classifying iris flowers in different species such as: setosa, versicolor and virginica. For each flower are known characteristics such as: length and width of the sepal, petal length and width. More details about this set can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris.
Using this information, decide which species a particular flower belongs to.
